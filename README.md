Consider a graph consisting of nodes and coloured lines.
Each color forms a complete sub-graph (i.e. in that subgraph all the 
nodes are connected to each other â€“ by
the way this is called a clique.) The challenge is to
divide the nodes into two equally sized groups so that
the number of colors between the groups is a minimum.
Note that if there is more than one line of the same color
between the two groups, the color is counted only once - in 
other words, we want to minimize the number of
colors (and not the number of lines) between the groups.

We were given adjacency matrices of different sizes ranging from 5x9 to 500x60.
Using the data we had to design our own algorithm that would divide and group the nodes equally
and so that their colour crossings were at a minimum. 

#### I achieved 80% for this assignment.
